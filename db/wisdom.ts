As they say in the “new physics,” it is not just an observable universe but a participatory universe.",

      "We are mostly unconscious of the other spiritual worlds. It is meant to be that way, for it is very dangerous when these worlds are opened up to man, just as Swedenborg said.... [He] said that we all have spirits with us; they are part of the foundation and energy of mental processes. ... Most mental experience is participated in by spirits who don't know themselves as anything other than your own feelings. Honed down to this fine level, the only thing left that is really yours is the struggle to choose. Those who aren't choosing are going the way the spiritual winds blow. So the pitiful picture of the hallucinated psychotic is really an exaggerated picture of everyone's situation.",

      "Time is in the soul; it is when the soul reflects its powers on the mind and the mind thinks, that time comes. When there was no soul, certainly there was no thought, and without thought, there was no time. How can the soul, therefore, be said to be existing in time, when time itself exists in the soul? It has neither birth nor death, but it is passing through all these various stages. It is manifesting slowly and gradually from lower to higher, and so on. It is expressing its own grandeur, working through the mind on the body; and through the body it is grasping the external world and understanding it. It takes up a body and uses it; and when that body has failed and is used up, it takes another body; and so on it goes.–Swami Vivekananda, Jnana Yoga",

      "What better way for God to know himself than to divide his awareness so that he can observe objectively as Creator and subjectively as Creation? Here physics and metaphysics merge to implode into cosmic solipsism. The Hermetic branch17 of the Perennial Philosophy reinforces this concept by stating that everything, from atoms of lead to the visions of Buddha, exists as a specific vibratory frequency within the cosmic mind. This idea agrees with the quantum physics hypothesis that reality somehow consists of consciousness observing either waves or particles.",

      "By changing the energy of the quarks and their combinations, one can create the atoms, elements, and molecules, including codons, RNA and DNA. These can then create cells, tissues, and people. All of these things, as we are taught, are composed of quanta of energy that combine to make matter-waves. Vibration, sound, and light are composed of waves. When wave fronts interact, the result is constructive or destructive interference and standing waves, creating a new 'hologram.' Standing waves take form (matter), and the interaction of the patterns creates molecules and the shape of what we will eventually conclude is the matter called people (a multidimensional, multi-layered hologram akin to the Chinese balls-inside-balls). The implication of this is that as we are constructed of subatomic particles, we must follow the basic rules of physics, although the multiple levels of interactions (interference patterns) can create an almost unfathomable complexity of interactions. ... Perhaps we are mobile, data-storing, self-programming, error-correcting, interacting holograms made visible by coherent light.",

      "At the highest conceptual level, the cosmos is a unity ('a universe') containing a multiplicity ('a multiverse') that reflects it at every level. A metaphor of this from the Kabbalistic branch of the Perennial Philosophy is that of the pomegranate—a fruit that is objectively One on the outside and subjectively Many on the inside. Each seed-fruit within the pomegranate observes itself and its fellow seeds, but cannot see the fruit in its entirety. For the sake of the metaphor, the whole fruit is assumed to be aware of itself both inside and out. To give a feeling for the concept of infinity, the symbol is next extended to include the notion of an 'orchard of pomegranates”—a sixteenth-century visualization of the many- universes hypothesis of quantum physics.'",
